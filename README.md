# caseflow
This was created as a project for my Software Engineering course at Oregon State University. This is a suite of tools intended to help educators with their caseloads - primarily teachers managing interventions in RTI or MTSS structures.

This is a work in progress - a first version with basic functionality has been completed. The program is built with a microservices architecture - the main program is a ASP .NET REST API, with four microservices created with Python. Messsage passing is done via ZeroMQ, and the frontend for the project was built with React.
